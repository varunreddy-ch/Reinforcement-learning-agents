### About the project

This is a project where I built self learning Atari game agents using the OpenAI gym and other open source environments using different algorithms such as the Actor-Critic method, DQN models and so on.

To know more about the details of the models, please go through the ppt.

### To run the code

Just run the ipynb notebooks by installing the necessary dependencies.
